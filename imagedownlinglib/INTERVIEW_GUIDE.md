# Image Loading Library - Interview Guide

This document explains the key concepts and design decisions in the Image Loading Library to help you confidently discuss it in interviews.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Talking Points

### 1. SOLID Principles Implementation

**Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
- Each class has one clear responsibility
- `MemoryCache` only handles memory caching
- `NetworkClient` only handles network operations
- `ImageDecoder` only handles image decoding
- `ImageLoader` only orchestrates the loading process

**Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
- Library is open for extension, closed for modification
- New cache strategies can be added by implementing `ImageCache`
- New network clients can be added by implementing `NetworkClient`
- New decoders can be added by implementing `ImageDecoder`

**Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
- All implementations can be substituted for their interfaces
- `MemoryCache`, `DiskCache`, and `NoCache` are all substitutable for `ImageCache`
- `OkHttpNetworkClient` is substitutable for `NetworkClient`

**Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
- Interfaces are focused and specific
- `ImageCache` only has caching methods
- `NetworkClient` only has network methods
- `ImageDecoder` only has decoding methods

**Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
- High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concretions
- `ImageLoader` depends on `ImageCache` interface, not specific implementations
- `ImageLoader` depends on `NetworkClient` interface, not OkHttp directly

### 2. Design Patterns Used

**Strategy Pattern**
```kotlin
// Different caching strategies
interface ImageCache {
    suspend fun get(key: String): Bitmap?
    suspend fun put(key: String, bitmap: Bitmap)
}

class MemoryCache : ImageCache { ... }
class DiskCache : ImageCache { ... }
class NoCache : ImageCache { ... }
```

**Builder Pattern**
```kotlin
// Fluent API for configuration
val config = ImageLoaderConfig.Builder(context)
    .memoryCacheSize(100 * 1024 * 1024)
    .diskCacheSize(500 * 1024 * 1024)
    .timeout(60)
    .enableLogging()
    .build()
```

**Factory Pattern**
```kotlin
// Centralized instance creation
object ImageLoaderFactory {
    fun initialize(context: Context, config: ImageLoaderConfig)
    fun getInstance(): ImageLoader
}
```

**Facade Pattern**
```kotlin
// Simple interface hiding complexity
object ImageLoader {
    fun load(url: String): ImageRequestBuilder
    fun cancel(url: String)
    fun clearCache()
}
```

**Observer Pattern**
```kotlin
// Callback mechanism for async operations
interface ImageCallback {
    fun onResult(result: ImageResult)
}
```

### 3. Architecture Benefits

**Testability**
- Each component can be unit tested independently
- Dependencies can be mocked easily
- Clear separation of concerns makes testing straightforward

**Maintainability**
- Changes in one component don't affect others
- Easy to add new features without breaking existing code
- Clear code organization and naming

**Performance**
- Efficient caching reduces network requests
- Memory management prevents OOM errors
- Async operations don't block UI thread

**Extensibility**
- Easy to add new cache strategies
- Easy to add new network clients
- Easy to add new image formats

### 4. Technical Implementation Details

**Caching Strategy**
- Memory cache uses LruCache for fast access
- Disk cache uses file system with MD5 hashing
- Two-level cache hierarchy (memory â†’ disk â†’ network)

**Memory Management**
- Automatic image resizing based on target dimensions
- Sample size calculation for memory efficiency
- Proper bitmap recycling

**Error Handling**
- Comprehensive exception hierarchy
- Specific error types for different failure scenarios
- Graceful degradation and recovery

**Threading**
- Coroutines for async operations
- Main thread for UI updates
- Background threads for I/O operations

### 5. Interview Questions & Answers

**Q: Why did you choose this architecture?**
A: I chose this architecture because it follows SOLID principles and makes the code maintainable, testable, and extensible. Each component has a single responsibility, and the use of interfaces allows for easy testing and future enhancements.

**Q: How do you handle memory management?**
A: I use several strategies: LruCache for memory caching with size limits, automatic image resizing based on target dimensions, sample size calculation to reduce memory usage, and proper bitmap recycling to prevent memory leaks.

**Q: How do you ensure thread safety?**
A: I use Kotlin Coroutines with proper dispatchers - IO dispatcher for network and disk operations, and Main dispatcher for UI updates. All cache operations are suspend functions that handle threading internally.

**Q: How would you add support for a new image format?**
A: I would create a new decoder implementing the `ImageDecoder` interface and register it in the configuration. The existing architecture makes this easy without modifying any existing code.

**Q: How do you handle network failures?**
A: I have comprehensive error handling with specific exception types. Network failures are caught and returned as `ImageResult.Error`, and the UI can handle them appropriately with fallback images or retry logic.

**Q: How do you prevent memory leaks?**
A: I use proper lifecycle management with coroutine scopes, automatic request cancellation when views are no longer needed, and proper bitmap recycling. The LruCache also automatically evicts old entries.
